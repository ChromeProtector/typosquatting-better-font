# typosquatting-better-font
A Unicode font(s) that aims to reduce the risks of typosquatting attacks

# Assumptions

1. The font(s) should help users see anything that is not from their alphabet or anything weird e.g. via:
  - different color
  - different background
  - special shape or border for anything "weird"
2. Due to licences new font(s) should be based on open-source fonts or the fonts should be created from scratch
3. Fonts should be in as many formats as possible
4. Fonts should be verified in tools that will measure how easier or harder is to do typosquatting attacks
